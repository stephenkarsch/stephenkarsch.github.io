My name is Stephen E. Karsch and I was born and raised in Bern, Switzerland. I graduated from Bern University of Applied Sciences with a bachelor's degree in Business Information Technology. At present I am working to get my master's from the Golden Gate University in San Francisco, California. Luckily, my father paid the tuition. ;)
I came to the United States just recently and so far I really like America, especially California and life here.
I make my living as a freelancer, providing coding services to clients that I find online. If you need some PHP/MySQL coding don't hesitate to contact me.
